# **Portfolio Version 2**
***

### **Description**
This is the second portfolio I have built, my original one was the very web application I made. The orginial site was built using Semantic HTML and CSS. Since learning React I have now re-built my portfolio using the new skills/knowledge I now have, .. this has made my application more interactive and intereting for the user. I designed the app using figma wirframe.. (link) 


Future development
